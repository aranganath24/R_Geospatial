# Introduction to Geospatial Analaysis Using R

This repository contains materials for an introductory workshop on geospatial analysis in R, which I developed and taught while I was a CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow at [NYU Data Services](https://guides.nyu.edu/dataservices). Part One of the workshop was inspired by an assignment in an Introductory GIS [course](http://sdgpolicyinitiative.org/gmteaching/) I took at UCSD, taught by Gordon McCord.

It is worth noting that if you are an R user interested in working with World Development Indicators (WDI) data from the World Bank, you can use the [WDI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WDI/WDI.pdf) package to query these datasets. I do not draw on this package in the tutorial's workflow, since I wanted to review the process (for pedagogical purposes) of downloading CSV data and reading it into R Studio.

The rendered markdown file containing the workshop's code and results is available [here](https://aranganath24.github.io/R_Geospatial/).
